Scenario: Mutation Score Calculation
Examples:
Given the respective mutation tests data
When the number of mutants killed is <mutantsKilled>
When the total number of mutants is <totalMutants>
Then the mutation score should be <mutationScore>

|mutantsKilled|totalMutants|mutationScore|
|16|16|1|
|8|16|0.5|
|4|16|0.25|
|8|32|0.25|
|4|32|0.125|

Example: {mutantsKilled=16, totalMutants=16, mutationScore=1}
Given the respective mutation tests data
When the number of mutants killed is 16
When the total number of mutants is 16
Then the mutation score should be 1

Example: {mutantsKilled=8, totalMutants=16, mutationScore=0.5}
Given the respective mutation tests data
When the number of mutants killed is 8
When the total number of mutants is 16
Then the mutation score should be 0.5

Example: {mutantsKilled=4, totalMutants=16, mutationScore=0.25}
Given the respective mutation tests data
When the number of mutants killed is 4
When the total number of mutants is 16
Then the mutation score should be 0.25

Example: {mutantsKilled=8, totalMutants=32, mutationScore=0.25}
Given the respective mutation tests data
When the number of mutants killed is 8
When the total number of mutants is 32
Then the mutation score should be 0.25

Example: {mutantsKilled=4, totalMutants=32, mutationScore=0.125}
Given the respective mutation tests data
When the number of mutants killed is 4
When the total number of mutants is 32
Then the mutation score should be 0.125
